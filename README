= Quiz

This little extension allows one to define simple multiple-choice quizzes that will select a result from a range of options and display a sub-page accordingly.

== Installation
cd <radiant_app>/vendor/extensions/
git clone <quiz_git_url> quiz

== Usage

A quiz body part might look like this:

  <h1>Quiz:</h1>
  <r:quiz:form>
    <r:questions:each>
      <h2>Question: <r:question /></h2>
      <ol style="list-style:none;">
        <r:options:each>
          <li><r:option_radio /> <r:option_label /></li>
        </r:options:each>
      </ol>
    </r:questions:each>
    <input type="submit">
  </r:quiz:form>

And the quiz part would look like so:

  questions:
    -
      - "What do you think of me?"
      - 1: You're great
      - 3: Can't stand you
      - 2: I'm pretty ambivalent
    -
      - "Do you like ice cream?"
      - 1: "Yes"
      - 2: Not so much
      - 3: Hate it
  results:
    3: cool
    5: ok
    6: messed-up

When a quiz is submitted, the weights that prefix each option get summed, and the first result who's weight exceeds the total gets redirected to (as a sub-page).
